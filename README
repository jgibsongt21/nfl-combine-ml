Obtaining the Data

Coralling the Data:
This data was obtained by copy and pasting rows of data into an
excel file. Data could not be pulled using a script because the
website uses a dynamic table backing to prevent requests, so I
needed to copy the data manually. Yes, it was tedious.

Re-running Experiments

Installing Scikit-learn
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run command "pip install scikit-learn"
Similar instructions can be run to also install numpy, pandas,
and matplotlib.

After all installations are made, the experiments can be rerun
by running each line of the Jupyter Notebook file sequantially.
The attached excel file should be in the same folder as the
Jupyter notebook file in order to do this. Aside from that,
all the experiments should work as planned (according to the
headers in the Jupyter notebook file).
